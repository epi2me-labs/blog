They\nare curated and actively maintained by experts in long-read sequence analysis.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started - Installation</h2>\n<p>We are excited to offer our bioinformatics solutions using the Nextflow\nreactive workflow framework. Nextflow has been selected as a preferred\nframework because of its integration with container technologies, software\npackage managers and its scalability to cluster- and cloud-scale installations.\nNextflow also has growing user adoption through projects such as\n<a href=\"https://nf-co.re/\">nf-core</a>. These advantages will help us deliver varied\nworkflows with minimal requirements for the installation of additional\nsoftware.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"/wfquickstart\">Workflows Quickstart</a> page for a walkthrough to guide\ninstallation of the pre-requisites for using our workflows in your computing\nenvironment.</p>\n<h2>Available workflows</h2>\n<p>Below you will find a complete list of available workflows with a short\ndescription of each.
