They\nare curated and actively maintained by experts in long-read sequence analysis.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started - Installation</h2>\n<p>We are excited to offer our bioinformatics solutions using the Nextflow\nreactive workflow framework. Nextflow has been selected as a preferred\nframework because of its integration with container technologies, software\npackage managers and its scalability to cluster- and cloud-scale installations.\nNextflow also has growing user adoption through projects such as\n<a href=\"https://nf-co.re/\">nf-core</a>. These advantages will help us deliver varied\nworkflows with minimal requirements for the installation of additional\nsoftware.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"/wfquickstart\">Workflows Quickstart</a> page for a walkthrough to guide\ninstallation of the pre-requisites for using our workflows in your computing\nenvironment.</p>\n<h2>Available workflows</h2>\n<p>Below you will find a complete list of available workflows with a short\ndescription of each. Each description is accompanied by a link to the\nGithub repository hosting the workflow and a sample workflow report.</p>\n<p>For more information on running workflows see our <a href=\"/wfquickstart\">Workflow Quick Start Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3>Basic Tasks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-alignment\">wf-alignment</a> packages the <a href=\"https://github.com/lh3/minimap2\">minimap2</a> software and streamlines the\nprocess of mapping sequence reads to a reference genome and preparing summary\nstatistics. It can also analyse the abundance of known molarity control\nexperiments and use this information to derive the abundances of other species\npresent in the sample. (<a href=\"/workflows/wf-alignment-report.html\">Sample report</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Calling</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-hap-snps\">wf-hap-snps</a>: a workflow for\nrunning small variant calling and annotation in haploid samples. (<a href=\"/workflows/wf-hap-snps-report.html\">Sample report</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Assembly</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-clone-validation\">wf-clone-validation</a>: assembly\nof small plasmid sequences, for verifying the results of molecular\ncloning experiments. (<a href=\"/workflows/wf-clone-validation.html\">Sample report</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Metagenomics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-metagenomics\">wf-metagenomics</a> includes the <a href=\"https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/\">Centrifuge</a> software and appropriate\nindexes to facilitate the taxonomic classification of sequence reads from\nmetagenome samples. (<a href=\"/workflows/wf-metagenomics-report.html\">Sample report</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-artic\">wf-artic</a>: a nextflow workflow for\nrunning the ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 workflow on multiplexed MinION, GridION, and\nPromethION runs.
