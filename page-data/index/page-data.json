The notebooks contain Python code needed to run data analysis,\nhowever zero configuration of the code is required. The notebooks can be used\nboth by <strong>students</strong> and <strong>researchers</strong> new to nanopore sequence data\nanalysis, and more experienced bioinformaticians who are comfortable working\nwith Python.</p>\n<p>The EPI2ME Labs server runs in a <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container\">Docker\ncontainer</a> to provide an\nisolated and resettable environment.</p>\n<h3>Getting started</h3>\n<p>EPI2ME Labs notebooks are supported on the GridION Mk1 sequencing platform as\nwell as any Windows 10, macOS, or Linux desktop.
