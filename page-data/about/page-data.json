Our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/epi2me-labs/tutorials\">GitHub</a> repository contains a\ngrowing collection of notebooks on a range of topics from basic quality control\nto genome assembly. These are free and open to use by anyone.</p>\n<p>EPI2ME Labs extends the JupyterLab notebook framework with a pre-configured\nanalysis server. The notebooks contain Python code needed to run data analysis,\nhowever zero configuration of the code is required. The notebooks can be used\nboth by <strong>students</strong> and <strong>researchers</strong> new to nanopore sequence data\nanalysis, and more experienced bioinformaticians who are comfortable working\nwith Python.</p>\n<p>The EPI2ME Labs server runs in a <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container\">Docker\ncontainer</a> to provide an\nisolated and resettable environment.</p>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<p>EPI2ME Labs notebooks are supported on the GridION Mk1 sequencing platform as\nwell as any Windows 10, macOS, or Linux desktop. All components are also\nreleased open-source in our <a href=\"https://github.com/epi2me-labs\">GitHub</a>\nrepository.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/quickstart\">Quick Start guide</a> will help you to get started running a\nnotebook server and web-based analyses.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/nbindex\">Index of Notebooks</a> page to see a complete listing with\ndescriptions.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/downloads\">Downloads</a> page contains a list of all available resources to\nget you started.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the Jupyter project, see\n<a href=\"https://www.jupyter.org/\">jupyter.org</a>.</p>"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"EPI2MELabs"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1462070832","240262808","2841359383"]}
