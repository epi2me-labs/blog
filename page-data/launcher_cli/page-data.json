Such users are typically running the server on a different,\nand more computationall capable, computer from where they are using the notebook\nweb interface.</p>\n<p>With the <a href=\"/downloads\">v1.0.8 release</a> of the launcher we have introduced the ability\nto start, stop, and check the status of the EPI2ME Labs notebook server from the\ncommand-line. The application is install to</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">/usr/local/bin/EPI2ME-Labs-Launcher/EPI2ME-Labs-Launcher</code></pre></div>\n<p>on Linux systems. On Ubuntu systems this is aliased as two commands, <code class=\"language-text\">labslauncher</code> and\n<code class=\"language-text\">labsmanager</code>, installed to:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">/usr/local/bin</code></pre></div>\n<p>which is typically listed in the <code class=\"language-text\">PATH</code> environment variable.</p>\n<p>Running the <code class=\"language-text\">EPI2ME-Labs-Launcher</code> (or <code class=\"language-text\">labslauncher</code> shortcut) will run the standard\nEPI2ME Labs Launcher with a graphic interface, and with logging to the terminal. However\nrunning:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">/usr/local/bin/EPI2ME-Labs-Launcher/EPI2ME-Labs-Launcher manager --help</code></pre></div>\n<p>(or simply <code class=\"language-text\">labsmanager --help</code> on Ubuntu) will initiate a simple command-line interface.\nThe interface has the following commands:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">  --start      Start the server.\n  --restart    Restart the server.\n  --stop       Stop a running server and cleanup resources.\n  --status     Report server status.\n  --update     Update server.</code></pre></div>\n<p>all of which should be fairly self-explanatory. The program will alert users if\nupdates are available for the server or for the program itself. The last\ncommand in the above can be used to update the notebook server component. For\nupdates to the Launcher application users should continue to download these\nfrom the <a href=\"/downloads\">downloads</a> page. (Users on Oxford Nanopore Technologies\nsequencing devices can also upgrade the Launcher through <code class=\"language-text\">apt</code>).</p>\n<p>When starting an EPI2ME Labs notebook server the full array of options\navailable in the graphical application are available to be set; running the\n<code class=\"language-text\">--help</code> command will display these. In contrast to the graphical interface,\nwhen using the command-line options are not stored in the applications settings\nfor subsequent use: users wishing to override the default value of options must\nsupply these options every time the program is run. This provides a more\nnatural command-line interface.</p>\n<p>We hope that users will find the new command-line interface useful and look\nforward to feedback.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"EPI2ME Labs Launcher Command-line interface","date":"February 10, 2021","description":"This post details how the EPI2ME Labs Launcher can now be controlled from the command-line, without resorting to a graphical interface."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/launcher_cli/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/release20.11/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"EPI2ME Labs 20.11 Release"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/release21.02/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"EPI2ME Labs 21.02 Release"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1462070832","240262808","2841359383"]}
